#Contributing

Pull requests are always welcome!

## How to contribute
Fork, then clone your repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/switchit.git

Install gulp-cli globally if you don't already have it:

    npm install -g gulp-cli
    
Make sure the tests pass and note the coverage percentage:

    gulp test

If they don't, please check our [issues page](https://github.com/dongryphon/switchit/issues) for known issues that
may cause the test faliure.

Make your change. Add tests for your change. Make the tests pass again and make sure to keep (or improve) the coverage percentage:

    gulp test

Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on us. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

- Write tests.
